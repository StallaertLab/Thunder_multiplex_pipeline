def get_tile_all_channels(img_lif_list, ch_num_list, im_ind):
    """
    Extracts a single tile across all specified channels from a list of LIF (Leica Image File) images. Each channel's data
    from the specified tile index is retrieved and compiled into a list.

    Parameters:
    - img_lif_list (list of LIF images): The list of LIF image objects to process.
    - ch_num_list (list of int): A list specifying the number of channels for each image in `img_lif_list`.
    - im_ind (int): The index of the tile to extract from each image.

    Returns:
    - numpy.ndarray: An array where each element is the data for one channel of the specified tile, extracted from all given images.

    Notes:
    - The function assumes that each LIF image object has a method `get_frame` which retrieves data based on z-stack level (z),
      time point (t), channel (c), and mosaic tile index (m).
    - This function is designed to work with LIF files that have multiple mosaic tiles and channels.

def create_tiles_99(img_lif_list, ch_num_list, frame_size=2048):
    """
    Extracts and rearranges individual tiles from lif files into a 9x9 grid format. Specifically designed for images tiled
    as circles within a 9x9 grid configuration, covering 69 collected tiles.

    Parameters:
    - img_lif_list (list): A list of lif images from which tiles are extracted.
    - ch_num_list (list): A list indicating the number of channels in each image from img_lif_list.
    - frame_size (int, optional): The dimension of each frame in pixels. Default is 2048 pixels.

    Returns:
    - list: A list of numpy arrays, each representing a tile. The tiles are arranged to form a 9x9 grid, where certain positions
      in the grid (corners) are filled with zero arrays to maintain the grid shape.

    Notes:
    - The grid positions that are not directly filled with image data from the lif files are filled with zero arrays of the
      same dimensions to preserve the 9x9 grid shape.
    - The function relies on a helper function `get_tile_all_channels` to extract tile data for each relevant grid position.
